For all you gearslutz out there! This free API is the only one out there (since I checked). Explore over 800 synthesizers from past and present. Get insight in their manufacturers and specifications. The API builds upon the data available on the vintagesynthexplorer website. Future work will be aimed to broaden querying options and let you fellow synth lovers contribute to the collection.

## About this Project

<br>

The goal of this project is to build an public REST API :dart: and thereby applying existing knowledge and explore new terrains. This was done independently by reading its documentation, watching online videos, consulting StackExchange & sometime my coach.

Although this project aimed at making a public API, I obviously tried it out myself! Therefore I made a [frontend](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-directory/tree/development/) that uses it. In development some features where added to the backend as well. Such as a route to suggest synthesizer and an admin login system.

<br>

Be sure to visit the :fire:[Synthesizer Directory](https://synthesizer-directory.netlify.app/):fire: as well.

<br>

### This repo contains three main folders:

<br>

> [SCRAPER](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/scraper) <br>

The scraper folder contains DOM oriented programming. Before I could fill the database with synthesizers, manufacturers & specification I needed to [scrape data](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/scraper/index.js). My source also had images, therefore I needed to [download images](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/scraper/index.js) from their respective URL's. After scraping the data it needed to be [normalized](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/scraper/index.js) to fit the SQL database structure. For this, some JS object/string manipulation was used.

> [SERVER](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/server) <br>

This folder is the heart of the project. It contains the server ([with database](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/server/models/)). You will find [endpoints](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/server/app.js) ([& queries](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/server/queries)) making use of [validation middlewares](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/server/validators/) ([& Yup](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/server/app.js)). People are able to suggest synths that can get approved through an admin login-system. Look around in [authorization](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/server/auth/jwt.js) ([& model](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/server/models/admin.js)) done through Express middlewares with JWT tokens, to see more of it. The development was mostly fuelled by [end-to-end testing](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/server/tests/). Another thing that needed to be done was [migrating images](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/server/cloudinary/) to Cloudinary db and save the image URL's to the main SQL database.

> [CLIENT](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/client) <br>

Here you can find the [API explorer](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/client) repo, done with ReactApp. Through the explorer an [apikey](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/server/sendEmail.js) can be sent to your email. It utilizes [frontend validation](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/client/src/pages/Autorization.js)(with React Hook Form) and some [storage concepts](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/client/src/context/AuthContext.js)(useContext) for the apikey.

### Leading topics:

<br>

> [ENVIRONMENTS](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/server/config/config.js) <br>

Throughout the project we have used the development, testing and production environments. Switching in/out sources and storing key's and secret's in .env and hosts.
Wrapping my head around it was challenging at first. Now I feel comfortable to use this in real projects.

<br>

> [END-TO-END TESTING](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/server/tests) <br>

All end-point have been thoroughly tested. The [testing](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/server/tests/) formed the basis of development in the project. Checking if correct responses were given & testing the possible 'un-happy' paths. This made me feel safe to refactor some code. Jest and Supertest were used in de backend, Jest & Playwright (like Puppeteer) in the frontend.

<br>

> [VALIDATION & ERROR HANDLING](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/server) <br>

Validation was done with Yup, used in the [backend](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/server/app.js) as well as the [frontend](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/client/src/pages/Autorization.js). Together with [middlewares](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/server/validators) to safeguarded the routes from user errors and send meaningful feedback to the client when they do occur.
Also validated in the backend: multipart/form-data & attachments.

<br>

> [AUTHENTIFICATION & PASSWORD HASHING](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/server/app.js) <br>

To be able to control the flow of user suggested synthesizers I implemented a admin login-system with JWT token. Although this was not my first encounter with this, it was the first time that I implemented it inside of my [model](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/server/models/admin.js) and validated expiration of the token. Hashing/comparing of the user's password is also done in the model directly.

## Usage

<br>

### API key

For each request send, you have to send your API key with it. It can be obtained through registering your email at [API explorer](https://60253856f22fd91ddd33781e--zen-brattain-86e1ab.netlify.app/Authorization).
The API key can be located anywhere inside the query string. The following example requests with and without additional queries are all valid:

```md
.../synths?key=<apiKey>
```

```md
.../synths?yearProduced=1980&key=<apiKey>
```

```md
.../synths?key=<apiKey>&yearProduced=1980
```

---

### Pagination

<br>

Calling any API endpoint without a resource ID or name will return a paginated list of available resources for that API. By default, a "page" will contain up to 20 resources. If you would like to change this just add a 'limit' query parameter to the GET request, e.g. ?=60. You can use 'offset' to move to the next page, e.g. ?limit=60&offset=60.

| Name   | Result                                   | Type    |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------- |
| offset | Get all synths/manufacturers with offset | integer |
| limit  | Get all synths/manufacturers with limit  | integer |

> **GET /synths/1**\
> <br> **GET /synths/Jupiter-8**

Get one synth resource, by either giving it's ID or exact name.

**NOTE:**\
All **specifications** and the **manufacturer** are of synth resources are delivered in a request by default. Specifying them specifically in a query is not necessary.
Some data is not normalized yet. This makes it only possible to query with exact name matches. Look into future work to see development goals for querying.

| Name         | Result                                                                | Type    |

<br>

## Future Work

<br>

This API is a work in process. Future work aims to improve querying, removing and/or adding queriable synth specifications and creating a moderated POST endpoint, to make you able to add to this collection.
